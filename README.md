### 01 Tokenizing Word and Sentence using NLTK
#### Token
  * Each "entity" that is a part of whatever was split up based on rules. 
  * For examples, each word is a token when a sentence is "tokenized" into words.
  * Each sentence can also be a token, if you tokenized the sentences out of a paragraph.
